Hi, I'm Chris Alfred Alcober. You can call me Chris. 

My interests include writing, science communication, language learning, and web development. I am a civil engineering graduate eyeing to venture on projects related to water resources, coastal, and environmental engineering.

I'm currently learning how to start my personal website from scratch. Although I already have my literary blog hosted in Blogspot, I intend to apply my knowledge in a C programming course that I took during my undergraduate study, and hopefully learn more about coding through GitHub.

You may reach me via email at cralcober@gmail.com for collaboration purposes or any form of correspondence.
